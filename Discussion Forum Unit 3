Provide a description of the try .. catch statement. As part of your description you must describe how this 
statement can be used to handle errors and exceptions and include an example of try ... catch implemented 
to handle an error or exception within a Java program.

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/try.html

basic format:

try {
    code
}
catch and finally blocks . . .

- used to catch runtime errors and handle them instaed of letting the program crash or...

- the catch part specifies the run time exceptions that you want to catch or handle yourself

- There can be multiple catch statements to catch different errors types

example: 

try {
	x = x/0;
} catch (ArithmeticException divideByZero) {
	System.out.println ( "You attempted to divide by zero");
}

second example:

public void openFile(){
        try {
            // constructor may throw FileNotFoundException
            FileReader reader = new FileReader("someFile");
            int i=0;
            while(i != -1){
                //reader.read() may throw IOException
                i = reader.read();
                System.out.println((char) i );
            }
            reader.close();
            System.out.println("--- File End ---");
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            //do something clever with the exception
        } catch (IOException e) {
            //do something clever with the exception
        }
    }
