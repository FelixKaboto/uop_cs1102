Classes serve as blank templates for creating objects, and you declare a class with the class keyword followed by 
the name of the class (uppercased or camelcased) and curly braces that contain the class's
methods, constructors and other fields. Constructors are used within the class to initialize new objects. 
Declarations lay out the state of the class. 

class MyClass {
	// field, constructor and method declarations
}

Methods implement the behavior of the class and its objects, and they have six components: (1) modifiers
(public, private, etc.); (2) return type (void, Int, etc.); (3) method name; (4) parameters list in parenthesis; 
(5) an exception list (not required); and the method body, enclosed in curly braces. 

public double myMethod(Int num) {
	// method body
}

Objects belong to classes and are inheret the attributes of their parent class.
