* A variable of type byte holds a string of eight bits, which can represent any of the integers between -128 and 127, inclusive. (There are 256 integers in that range; eight bits can represent 256 -- two raised to the power eight -- different values.) As for the other integer types,
* short corresponds to two bytes (16 bits). Variables of type short have values in the range -32768 to 32767.
* int corresponds to four bytes (32 bits). Variables of type int have values in the range -2147483648 to 2147483647.
* long corresponds to eight bytes (64 bits). Variables of type long have values in the range -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807.
* The float data type is represented in four bytes of memory, using a standard method for encoding real numbers. The maximum value for a float is about 10 raised to the power 38. A float can have about 7 significant digits. (So that 32.3989231134 and 32.3989234399 would both have to be rounded off to about 32.398923 in order to be stored in a variable of type float.) 
* A double takes up 8 bytes, can range up to about 10 to the power 308, and has about 15 significant digits. Ordinarily, you should stick to the double type for real values.
* A variable of type char occupies two bytes in memory. The value of a char variable is a single character such as A, *, x, or a space character. The value can also be a special character such a tab or a carriage return or one of the many Unicode characters that come from different languages. Values of type char are closely related to integer values, since a character is actually stored as a 16-bit integer code number. In fact, we will see that chars in Java can actually be used like integers in certain situations.
* In a program, you represent constant values as literals. A literal is something that you can type in a program to represent a value. It is a kind of name for a constant value.
* To make a literal of type float, you have to append an "F" or "f" to the end of the number. For example, "1.2F" stands for 1.2 considered as a value of type float.
