// develop a program that reads the file icecream.dat (supplied in the â€œFiles for Unit 3 Assignment)
// Use TextIO methods to read the file
// Count the total number of ice cream cones that were sold (number of lines that you read from the file) 
// Count the total number of "Strawberry" cones that were sold.

// Print out the total number of cones, the number of Strawberry cones, and the percentage of cones that were Strawberry.

// TextIO has a function named TextIO.eof() to check whether the entire file has been read
// The value of this function is true if the entire file has been read
// The value is false if there is more data in the file
// You want to continue reading from the file as long as TextIO.eof() is false.

// If flavor is a variable of type String and you want to test whether its value is "Strawberry", 
// test whether flavor.equals("Strawberry"). (Do not use == to test for equality of Strings.)

// Each line of the file icecream.dat is an ice cream flavor such as "Vanilla" or "Strawberry." 
// A line represents the sale of one ice cream cone of the given flavor.

// Make sure that you create both the TextIO.java and the icecream.dat files as java project files
// I found it was easier to rename icecream.dat to icecream.txt for some reason. 
// For students using Netbeans, use the same set of rules that were defined in Unit 2 to setup your 
// project and include the TextIO.java file as we did in unit 2
// Make sure that you copy the icecream.dat file into your project directory so that it can be found by your java program.
