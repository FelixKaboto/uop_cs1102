Describe the for loop and compare with the for-each loop by describing the operation of each and discussing 
how they differ from each other. You must include the role of enums in your description and provide an example 
of a for loop and a for-each loop.

Note1: Just a reminder than adding code samples, diagrams, link to pages or videos will increase the likelihood 
for you to address multiple learning styles through your response.

Note2: Please take into account Note 1 above when assessing / responding to your peer's posting.

For loops contain an initial value the loop will start at, a condition for the loop to continue and an increment or 
decrement value. While the condition evaluates to true, the statements inside the loop will continue to be 
evaluated. When the condition evaluates to false, the for loop ends. For loops are constructed like this
(http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c3/s4.html):

for ( initialization; continuation-condition; update )
     statement

For-each loops omit the iterator (condition), making the code cleaner and reducing the chance for errors
(http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/foreach.html). They are constructed like this:

for (TimerTask t : c)
        statement

This translates to for each TimerTask t in c, or for each item in a sequence.
